# Multiagent-ReinforcementLearning-Monopoly
This repository consists of an open-source Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning(MARL) environment that allows collaboration between agents. It also trains collaborative RL Agents using StableBaselines3 and PPO algorithm that won 98.8\% of the time against static agents.

The below video is a demonstration of our environment. It also shows how the trained RL agents are collaborating and making one of the agents win the game(own all the tiles) when playing against static agents.
