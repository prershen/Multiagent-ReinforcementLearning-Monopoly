# Multiagent-ReinforcementLearning-Monopoly
This repository consists of an open-source Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning(MARL) environment that allows collaboration between agents. It also trains collaborative RL Agents using StableBaselines3 and PPO algorithm that won 98.8\% of the time against static agents.
